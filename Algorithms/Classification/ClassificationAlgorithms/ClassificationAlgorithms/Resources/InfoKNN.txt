K Nearest Neighbors- classification algorithm

Features:
+Read data file. You can read cvs file type data. 

-K element input - program takes k nearest neighbors data objects which is near to test object  
and decides which class will be set to the test data.

-Select rows input - you can select which column data you will use to learn a algorithm
by typing column numbers 1,2...n. Each number need to be separated with commas.

-Class column input - you select which column(number) is class type column. The program selects all class types.

-New object input - you can test a algorithm with own test data. 
You input data which is separated with commas (you need exact same amount data elements as "select rows input").

When you press calculate button the console shows which class type is your test object.
