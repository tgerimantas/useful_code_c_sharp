DBSCAN - clustering algorithm

DBSCAN needs two elements:
- Epsilon -  specifies how close points should be to each other to be considered a part of a cluster.
- Min Points - specifies how many neighbors a point should have to be included into a cluster.

Features:
+ Read data file.
You can read cvs file type data. 
When you open data file you need to select x and y data columns so it set all data to diagram.

+ Select data points points on the diagram.
In Points section you can select (by clicking in diagram section), 
remove all data and generate randomly data points.
